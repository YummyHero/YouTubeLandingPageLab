<h1>Youtube Web Page Practice</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
For a self-practicing project, I built a web page that replicates the YouTube front page using HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project was to enhance my web development skills and gain practical experience in front-end design. I utilized HTML for structuring the content and CSS for styling to achieve a visually accurate copy of YouTube's interface. The result was a fully responsive web page that mimicked YouTube's layout and design elements. This project improved my understanding of web design principles and responsive design techniques.
